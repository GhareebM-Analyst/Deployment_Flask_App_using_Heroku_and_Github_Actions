# Deployment_of-Dockerized-Flask_App_using_Heroku_and_Github_Actions

In this project, xgboost algorithm was used to build a regression model to predict the medical cost utilizing age, sex, body mass index(bmi) , number of children, smoker/non-smoker, and region. The final model explained 82% of the variability in the data.
More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).

 
The process of model development include is showing in this [Jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/End-to-End-Project-Development-a-Regression-Model-and-Deployment-using-Flask-App-to-the-Web-using-/blob/main/Medical_Cost.ipynb):
1.	Data analysis
2.	Feature engineering 
3.	Model selection 
4.	Model evaluation
5.	Model storing in local disk (pickling)
